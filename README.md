# Pokedex App

## Setup

  * At this time you will need to open the index.html file directly to use the application.
  * Once we host this frontend application, we will provide a link to it directly.

## Usage

  * This application supports user accounts.
  * As a trainer you can create new teams, add pokemon to your teams, remove pokemon from those teams, and delete teams.
  * We currently support all 807 pokemon up to the generation 7 games except for the two specific to the Let's go Pikachu and Let's go Eevee games.
  * You can filter the pokemon displayed on our main window using the name search, and generation filter options that are displayed in the header.
  * You can also use the type buttons to filter all pokemon with that type.

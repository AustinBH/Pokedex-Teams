# Pokedex App

## Setup

  * At this time, the repo can be cloned down and you can open the index.html file in your browser
  * You can also visit the [Site](https://austinbh.github.io/Pokedex-frontend/) where it is currently hosted

## Use this application

  * This application supports user accounts.
  * As a trainer you can create new teams, add pokemon to your teams, remove pokemon from those teams, and delete teams.
  * We currently support all 807 pokemon up to the generation 7 games except for Meltan and Melmetal.
  * There are also 3 different ways that you can filter the pokemon displayed on the main page.
    - Name
      - There is a Name Search field at the top of the page which lets you search for pokemon by name
      - This search field does not require an exact match, searching for "char" will display all pokemon with char in their name
    - Generation
      - There is a Generation select menu at the top of the page
      - This will display all pokemon specific to the generation that you select
    - Type
      - By clicking on a pokemon's type, you can display all pokemon of that type
      - The type buttons work from both the main landing page as well as from the individual pokemon pages
